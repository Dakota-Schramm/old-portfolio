    <header id="operator">Operators</header>
    <p id=text>Within Python operators, there are several different types of operators to take note of. </p>
    <ul id=text>
      <li>Arithmetic <code>(+, -, *, /)</code></li>
      <li>Logical<code>(and, or, not)</code></li>
      <li>Bitwise<code>(&, |, ^)</code></li>
      <li>Lists<code> [1,2,3,4,5] </code></li>
      <li>Strings<code> "Hello, World"</code></list>
    </ul>
    <p id="text">While there are certainly more operators that exist, such as those that work on strings and lists, these are rather important ones, so much so that they're used within other languages as well.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="if/else">
    <header id="if-else">If/Else</header>
    <p id=text>If/else statements are extrememly useful for controlling the flow of control within the program. For example, you can make the program perform a certain action if a number given in the input is even: </p>
    <code>if x%2==0:
      return True
      
    </code>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="while">
    <header id="while">While</header>
    <p id=text>While loops are useful when a for loop doesn't quite cover it.</p>
    <p id=text>To review, a for loop is useful when you want to iteratively perform some action and terminate this action when a certain condition is met. For example, you might want to iterate through a range of indexes defined by the length of the list.</p>
    <p id=text>While loops work similarly, except the condition that is used for the loop isn't as strictly defined as a for loop. For example, you may want to continue using a while loop until your input number becomes negative once you've subtracted from it so many times.
