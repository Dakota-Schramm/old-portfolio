Portfolio website for Dakota Schramm

# Things to work on
    - Finish formatting main portfolio page, create smaller
    portfolio pages for project and subject coursework page.
    - Fix navbar at top to work with portfolio pages.
    - Fix main page to more generally include skills.
        Stuff toward top with language skills is fine, just
        should limit projects being showcased on main page.
    - Figure out how to build portfolio using a template
        instead of making new page for each.
    - Change c.html --> Remove header placed above where 
    headers supposed to go in content section, just do with 
    one header and list underneath for topics after going to page.
    - Change footer to have contact info at bottom of every page.
        - Can do using class fl_left in footer with list
        - Add icons to list and just input that way.
